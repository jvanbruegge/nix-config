# My NixOS configuration

This repository contains the complete configuration for my personal laptop. In the future this might be expanded to also include my NAS server.

I am using [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Using_nix_flakes_with_NixOS) together with [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to manage everything.

The main entrypoint is [configuration.nix](./configuration.nix)
